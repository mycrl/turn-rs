    /// Figure 1 shows a typical deployment.  In this figure, the TURN client
    /// and the TURN server are separated by a NAT, with the client on the
    /// private side and the server on the public side of the NAT.  This NAT
    /// is assumed to be a "bad" NAT; for example, it might have a mapping
    /// property of "address-and-port-dependent mapping" (see [RFC4787]).
    ///
    /// The client talks to the server from a (IP address, port) combination
    /// called the client's "host transport address".  (The combination of an
    /// IP address and port is called a "transport address".)
    ///
    /// The client sends TURN messages from its host transport address to a
    /// transport address on the TURN server that is known as the "TURN
    /// server transport address".  The client learns the TURN server
    /// transport address through some unspecified means (e.g.,
    /// configuration), and this address is typically used by many clients
    /// simultaneously.
    ///
    /// Since the client is behind a NAT, the server sees packets from the
    /// client as coming from a transport address on the NAT itself.  This
    /// address is known as the client's "server-reflexive transport
    /// address"; packets sent by the server to the client's server-reflexive
    /// transport address will be forwarded by the NAT to the client's host
    /// transport address.
    ///
    /// The client uses TURN commands to create and manipulate an ALLOCATION
    /// on the server.  An allocation is a data structure on the server.
    /// This data structure contains, amongst other things, the relayed
    /// transport address for the allocation.  The relayed transport address
    /// is the transport address on the server that peers can use to have the
    /// server relay data to the client.  An allocation is uniquely
    /// identified by its relayed transport address.
    ///
    /// Once an allocation is created, the client can send application data
    /// to the server along with an indication of to which peer the data is
    /// to be sent, and the server will relay this data to the intended peer.
    /// The client sends the application data to the server inside a TURN
    /// message; at the server, the data is extracted from the TURN message
    /// and sent to the peer in a UDP datagram.  In the reverse direction, a
    /// peer can send application data in a UDP datagram to the relayed
    /// transport address for the allocation; the server will then
    /// encapsulate this data inside a TURN message and send it to the client
    /// along with an indication of which peer sent the data.  Since the TURN
    /// message always contains an indication of which peer the client is
    /// communicating with, the client can use a single allocation to
    /// communicate with multiple peers.
    ///
    /// When the peer is behind a NAT, the client must identify the peer
    /// using its server-reflexive transport address rather than its host
    /// transport address.  For example, to send application data to Peer A
    /// in the example above, the client must specify 192.0.2.150:32102 (Peer
    /// A's server-reflexive transport address) rather than 203.0.113.2:49582
    /// (Peer A's host transport address).
    ///
    /// Each allocation on the server belongs to a single client and has
    /// either one or two relayed transport addresses that are used only by
    /// that allocation.  Thus, when a packet arrives at a relayed transport
    /// address on the server, the server knows for which client the data is
    /// intended.
